Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, the facility initiated corrective action. The facility warden directed the housing officers and maintenance staff to clean all the surface areas of the seven dorm showers. LPC’s warden issued a memorandum to all housing officers to ensure all dorm showers are inspected daily by post officers and weekly by duty supervisors.

LPC went from 3 deficient standards and 3 deficiencies in March 2024 to 1 deficient standard and 1 deficiency during this most recent inspection. LPC completed its uniform corrective action plan for its last inspection in March 2024, which likely resolved the previous deficiencies ODO cited.

ODO observed 13 showers in 7 housing units and found in 5 out of 13 showers, discolored and stained walls in housing units 1, 2, and 3 (Deficiency EHS-589).",
      "SECURITY": "ODO reviewed KCJF’s website and found no posted SAAPI protocols (Deficiency SAAPI-1610).",
      "CARE": "ODO interviewed the food service administrator, reviewed facility FS logs, and found facility staff did not record daily water temperature checks of the kitchen hand sinks (Deficiency FS-11711). ODO reviewed the controlled substances inventory and found the following on-hand quantities did not match corresponding inventory logs: 28 Clonazepam (1 mg) tablets on-hand and 25 logged; 42 Tramadol (50 mg) tablets on-hand and 34 logged; and 2 Diazepam (10 mg/2 ml) syringes on-hand and 3 logged. ODO noted the discrepancy in the controlled substances inventory as an Area of Concern. ODO reviewed the suicide watch logs for 2 detainees placed on continuous monitoring and found in 1 out of 2 logs, clinical staff documented monitoring of the detainee every 17-minutes instead of every 15-minutes (Deficiency SSHSPI-2112). This is a priority component.",

      "CONCLUSION": "During this unannounced compliance inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 21 standards under NDS 2019 and found the facility in compliance with 17 of those standards. ODO found six deficiencies in the remaining four standards. Since KCJF’s last rated inspection in March 2024, the facility’s compliance with NDS 2019 has trended upward. KCJF went from 8 deficiencies in 4 standards, including 1 priority component and 2 repeat deficiencies, in March 2024 to 5 deficiencies in 4 standards, which included 1 priority component, during this most recent inspection. KCJF completed its UCAP for its last inspection in March 2024, which likely resolved ODO’s previously cited deficiencies. ODO recommends ERO Chicago continue to work with the facility to resolve the deficiencies in accordance with contractual obligations.",

      "SECURITY": "ODO reviewed 50 detainee SMU 30-minute observation logs and found in 27 out of 50 logs, facility staff recorded observations on a regular schedule, i.e., on the hour and 30 minutes past each hour (Deficiency SMU-8413). This is a repeat deficiency and a priority component.",
      "CARE": "ODO reviewed the training files of non-dental clinicians and found a dentist did not train the non-dental clinicians annually on how to conduct dental exams (Deficiency MC-4514). This is a repeat deficiency. ODO reviewed medical files of detainees with prescribed psychotropic medications and found in out of files, no separate documented informed consent for the medications administered (Deficiency MC-9315). This is a repeat deficiency and a priority component. ODO reviewed the professional credentials of three health care prescribers and found in three out of three credentials, valid certifications but only one out of three was verified by the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). The three prescribers included a physician, a nurse practitioner, and a physician assistant. ICE NDS 2019 requires a detention facility to pursue, not achieve, accreditation by the National Commission on Correction Health Care when verifying healthcare prescriber credentials. ODO identified this inconsistency in NPDB verification as an Area of Concern.",
      "ACTIVITIES": "N/A",
      "JUSTICE": "N/A",
      "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 21 standards under NDS 2019 and found the facility in compliance with 18 of those standards. ODO found nine deficiencies in the remaining three standards. Since GCJ’s last rated inspection in February 2024, the facility’s overall compliance has trended upward. GCJ went from 9 deficient standards and 25 deficiencies in February 2024, to 3 deficient standards and 9 deficiencies during this most recent inspection.

OCJ went from no deficient standards and no deficiencies in November 2023 to two deficient standards and two deficiencies during this most recent inspection, with one priority component deficiency in the SSHSPI standard for suicide watch logs. A uniform corrective action plan was not required for ODO’s last rated inspection of OCJ in November 2023.

This is a repeat deficiency; No inspection by staff of all open containers nor inventory of factory-sealed durable goods in accordance with facility procedures (Deficiency AR-199). This is a repeat deficiency; No search by staff of detainee property nor inventory or receipt of property identified as funds, valuables, or other personal property (Deficiency AR-2010); and No itemized list of detainee baggage and personal property using the personal property inventory form or its equivalent (Deficiency AR-4011). This is a repeat deficiency. ODO reviewed released detainee files and found in out of files, the detainees did not check their property against the original personal property inventory form nor sign the inventory sheet (Deficiency AR-9012).",
      "CARE": "ODO observed the facility’s pharmaceutical prescription pass-out procedures and toured the pharmacy room on October 30, 2024. ODO observed medical staff remove the labels from prescription bottles intended to be administered to four detainees housed in the Special Management Unit (SMU). Medical staff placed the detainees’ prescription medicines in unlabeled envelopes with the detainee’s name and A-Number, but did not label the envelopes with the medications in them. A licensed nurse confirmed nursing staff take the envelopes to the SMU and administer the medications from the envelope to the detainees, but do not take the medication administration record for each detainee. Removal of medication from pharmacy-labeled prescription bottles and repackaging them in unlabeled envelopes and administering medication without the use of a medication administration record do not comply with IHSC Medication Administration and rules of the Arizona Board of Nursing’s practice guidelines (Deficiency MC-9622).",

      "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 28 standards under PBNDS 2011 (Revised 2016) and found the facility in compliance with 25 of those standards. ODO found 16 deficiencies in the remaining 3 standards. Since EFCF’s last rated inspection in October 2023, the facility’s overall compliance has trended downward. EFCF went from 1 deficient standard and 1 deficiency in October 2023 to 3 deficient standards and 16 deficiencies during this most recent inspection, which included 13 repeat deficiencies. EFCF completed its uniform corrective action plan for its follow-up inspection in May 2024; however, it may not have been sufficient to prevent the repeat deficiencies ODO identified during this inspection. ODO recommends ERO Phoenix continue to work with the facility to resolve the deficiencies that remain outstanding in accordance with contractual obligations.",

ODO observed hazardous substances stored in the laundry department and found no perpetual inventory of its stock of 7 gallons of No Splash Bleach, 5 gallons of Liquid Laundry Chlorine Bleach, and 10 gallons of Liquid Laundry Built Detergent (Deficiency EHS-310). ODO observed hazardous substances stored in the laundry department and found no inventory records for 7 gallons of No Splash Bleach, 5 gallons of Liquid Laundry Chlorine Bleach, and 10 gallons of Liquid Laundry Built Detergent in the laundry department storage closet (Deficiency EHS-411). ODO reviewed the master index of all hazardous substances in the facility and found the following deficiencies: No index, location, nor safety data sheets (SDS) for three hazardous substances located in the laundry department and five hazardous substances located in the food service department (Deficiency EHS-812); No documentation of reviews in the SDS master file (Deficiency EHS-913); and No comprehensive, up-to-date list of emergency phone numbers (fire department, poison control center, etc.) in the SDS master file (Deficiency EHS-1014).

ODO found nine deficiencies in the remaining two standards. This was FCDC’s first inspection under NDS 2019 and ODO did not conduct a trend analysis. LCDC went from 2 deficient standards and 7 deficiencies in July 2023 under the NDS 2000 to 2 deficient standards and 9 deficiencies during this most recent special review, which included 1 priority component deficiency in EHS. ODO did not assess the effect the previous inspections UCAP had on the facility’s compliance with NDS 2019 standards due to the change from NDS 2000 standards to NDS 2019 standards. ODO recommends ERO Chicago work with the facility to resolve any deficiencies that remain outstanding in accordance with contractual obligations.",

NDCTR completed its UCAP for its last inspection in January 2024, which may not have been sufficient to prevent the repeat deficiencies ODO identified during this follow-up inspection.

ODO found seven deficiencies in the remaining four standards. Since FCADC’s last rated inspection in March 2024, the facility’s compliance with NDS 2019 has trended downward. FCADC went from 1 deficient standard and 2 deficiencies in March 2024 to 4 deficient standards and 7 deficiencies during this most recent inspection. The deficiencies included four priority component deficiencies. FCADC completed its UCAP for its last inspection in March 2024, which likely resolved the previous deficiencies ODO cited. ODO recommends ERO Saint Paul continue to work with the facility to resolve the remaining deficiencies in accordance with contractual obligations.",

      "CONCLUSION": "During this special review, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 10 standards under NDS 2019 and found the facility in compliance with 5 of those standards. ODO found 27 deficiencies in the remaining 5 standards. ODO found most of the deficiencies to be administrative in nature, including the lack of a hazardous material program, a common-fare menu, and inadequate training for facility staff. ODO also noted two priority component deficiencies for EHS and SSHSPI. Because this was ODO’s first inspection of JCJ, ODO did not conduct a trend analysis. ODO recommends ERO Salt Lake City work with the facility to resolve the remaining deficiencies in accordance with contractual obligations.",

RGDC went from two deficient standards and two deficiencies to no deficient standards and no deficiencies during this most recent follow-up inspection. ODO received a completed UCAP for the facility’s last ODO inspection in December 2023, which resolved the two previous deficiencies.

This is a priority component; • No system for storing, issuing, and maintaining inventories of, and accountability for, such hazardous materials as the following: Delimer Spar Cleaner Detergent; Pot & Pan Detergent; T-10 Sanitizer; Protech Citrus Disinfectant Spray; Hospital Surface Disinfectant Spray Citrace; Hospital Disinfectant & Deodorizer; and Isopropyl Alcohol (Deficiency EHS-28); • No perpetual inventory of the hazardous substances as listed in Deficiency EHS-2 (Deficiency EHS-39); • No inventory records for the hazardous substances as listed in Deficiency EHS-2 (Deficiency EHS-410); • No maintained file of corresponding SDSs for the following materials: Protech Citrus Disinfectant Spray; Hospital Surface Disinfectant Spray Citrace; Hospital Disinfectant & Deodorizer; Isopropyl Alcohol; PSQ II; and Clothesline Chlorine Bleach (Deficiency EHS-511); • No ready and continuous access by staff to SDSs for chemicals used in the food and health service areas (Deficiency EHS-612); • No SDS files for the maintenance supervisor to review (Deficiency EHS-713); • No designee to compile a master index of all hazardous substances in the facility to include their locations and a master file of SDSs (Deficiency EHS-814); • No SDS master file nor reviews conducted of the hazardous substances stored in the facility (Deficiency EHS-915); • No master index nor up to date list of emergency phone numbers (fire department, poison control center, etc.) (Deficiency EHS-1016); • The facility did not provide hazardous materials training to staff and there were no SDSs in any of the areas where hazardous substances were stored (Deficiency EHS-1117); • No inventory records for hazardous substances in the food and health service chemical areas (Deficiency EHS-1618); and • The facility did not train staff on the classification code and safe handling procedures for each material (Deficiency EHS-2319). ODO interviewed a facility lieutenant, reviewed the facility’s emergency plans (EP) policy, and found the facility staff had not reviewed nor updated the EP since ERO New Orleans began housing detainees in this facility in 2020 (Deficiency EHS-2720). ODO interviewed the health services director (HSD), inspected the medication room, and found the HSD did not keep a perpetual/running inventory for the following items posing a security risk: 68 catheters, 306 needles, and 122 syringes (Deficiency EHS-5121). ODO interviewed the HSD and found the HSD, or a designee did not reconcile medical sharps inventories weekly (Deficiency EHS-5222).",

This is a priority component. ODO interviewed the FSD and found a registered dietitian did not certify the menus before implementation (Deficiency FS-3324). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed the FS program, interviewed the FSD, and found the following deficiencies: • No “common fare” menu serving as a foundation for modifications to accommodate a variety of religious diets (Deficiency FS-5725); • No common-fare menu with a no-flesh protein option offering vegetables, starches, and other foods not seasoned with flesh and providing a choice instead of an entrée containing flesh (Deficiency FS-5826); • No common fare menu based on a 14-day cycle with special menus for the 10 Federal holidays (Deficiency FS-6027); • No common fare menu certified as exceeding minimum daily nutritional requirements, nor meeting or exceeding US recommended daily allowances (Deficiency FS-6128); • No disposable plates and utensils or reusable plates and utensils set aside for common-fare (Deficiency FS-6529); and • No common-fare program to accommodate detainees abstaining from foods or fasting for religious purposes at prescribed times of the year (Deficiency FS-7130). ODO interviewed the FSD and found the facility did not implement written procedures for administrative or FS personnel to conduct weekly inspections of all FS areas, including dining, storage, equipment, and food-preparation areas nor an annual independent inspection to ensure compliance with all governmental health and safety codes (Deficiency FS-11631). ODO inspected the FS department, interviewed the FSD, and found the facility staff did not conduct temperature checks for the dishwasher after every meal (Deficiency FS-11832). ODO inspected the FS department, interviewed the FSD, and found the facility staff did not file all temperature-check documentation (Deficiency FS-11933). ODO interviewed a facility lieutenant and the HSD, reviewed training records for correctional staff and medical staff, and found in out of records, the facility staff did not receive initial and annual training to recognize the signs of a hunger strike nor to implement procedures for referral for a medical assessment of detainees on a hunger strike (Deficiency HS-134). ODO interviewed the HSD, reviewed the MC policy and medical staff training records, and found in out of training records, non-dental clinicians did not receive annual training on how to conduct a dental exam by a dentist (Deficiency MC-4535). ODO reviewed the MC policy and the facility-specific detainee handbook and found the handbook did not disclose to detainees and their representatives how to request and receive medical records.",

      "SAFETY": "ODO interviewed the facility’s building and grounds supervisor, reviewed the master index, and found the index did not include a comprehensive, up-to-date list of emergency phone numbers (fire department, poison control, etc.) (Deficiency EHS-109). ODO interviewed a facility lieutenant, reviewed the facility’s emergency plans, and found the facility staff last reviewed and updated the emergency plans on November 30, 2019 (Deficiency EHS-2710). ODO interviewed a facility lieutenant, observed the facility barber operations, and found no lavatory, no sink with hot and cold running water, nor available waterless hand sanitizer in the barbershop (Deficiency EHS-4611). ODO interviewed a facility lieutenant, observed the facility barber operations, and found barbers did not clean nor disinfect all hair care tools between use for each detainee (Deficiency EHS-4812). ODO toured the facility and found in housing unit F, one shower with hard water and soap scum buildup and one shower with a bottle of shampoo and pieces of soap on the shower floor (Deficiency EHS-5813).",
      "SECURITY": "ODO interviewed a facility sergeant and a detention technician, reviewed detainee detention files for detainees that arrived at the facility with identity documents and found the facility forwarded the original documents to ERO Salt Lake City without first copying the documents and placing in the detainee detention files (Deficiency AR-1214). ODO found facility staff permitted the ODO inspection team to enter and exit the facility without first conducting a check of identification documents (Deficiency FSC-1515). ODO interviewed a facility sergeant and a detention technician, reviewed detainee detention files for detainees that arrived at the facility with identity documents and found the facility forwarded the original documents to ERO Salt Lake City without first copying the documents and placing in the detainee detention files (Deficiency FPP-1016).",
      "CARE": "ODO interviewed a facility lieutenant, reviewed the facility’s inventory sheet and PH policy, and found on May 9, 2024, the facility housed detainees; however, the facility had only 13 towels available in supply. Additionally, the facility did not provide ODO with an inventory of sheets and pillows in supply to verify a sufficient supply of both were on-hand (Deficiency PH-223). ODO interviewed a facility supervisor, observed PH hygiene kits provided to detainees upon admission, reviewed property-issued forms, and found detainees had to purchase skin lotion from the facility’s commissary (Deficiency PH-1424). ODO interviewed a facility lieutenant, toured detainee housing units, and found the facility did not provide detainees with a reasonably private toilet facility and observed entrances to toilets as completely open and in the direct line of sight of other detainees, staff, and visitors (Deficiency PH-1825); detainees the privacy required to perform bodily functions without being viewed by staff of the opposite gender and observed entrances to toilets as completely open and in the direct line of sight of other detainees, staff, and visitors (Deficiency PH-1926); and detainees with disabilities the amenities nor the support needed for self-care and personal hygiene in a reasonably private environment and observed entrances to toilets as completely open and in the direct line of sight of other detainees, staff, and visitors (Deficiency PH-2227).",
      "ACTIVITIES": "ODO interviewed a facility lieutenant, reviewed the facility’s electronic recreation logs for 4 detainees, and found from April 14 to May 7, 2024, the facility only offered recreation to the detainees 14 out of 24 days (Deficiency R-329). This is a repeat deficiency and a priority component. ODO interviewed a facility lieutenant, reviewed the facility’s electronic logs for 2 detainees housed in the SMU, and found from April 14 to May 7, 2024, the facility only offered recreation to the detainees for 5 out of 24 days (Deficiency R-1530). This is a priority component. ODO toured six detainee housing units and found three out of six units did not have notices posted at each telephone notifying detainees that their calls were subject to monitoring (Deficiency TA-4131).",
      "JUSTICE": "ODO interviewed 24 detainees, a facility lieutenant, reviewed 25 detainee handbook electronic logs, and found the facility provides facility and ICE National Detainee Handbooks to detainees electronically via housing unit tablets; however, the detainee acknowledgement form does not clearly indicate that detainees acknowledge receipt of both handbooks, which ODO notes as an Area of Concern. ODO reviewed one grievance a detainee submitted to ERO Salt Lake City staff on April 27, 2024, and found ERO Salt Lake City staff did not respond until May 8, 2024 (Deficiency GS-1532).",
      "CONCLUSION": "During this follow-up inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 18 standards under NDS 2019 and found the facility in compliance with 8 of those standards. ODO found 24 deficiencies in the remaining 10 standards. Since NCDC’s last full inspection in October 2023, the facility’s compliance with the NDS 2019 has trended down. NCDC went from 4 deficient standards and 12 deficiencies in October 2023 to 10 deficient standards and 24 deficiencies during this most recent inspection. Ten out of 24 deficiencies were in the EHS and PH standards, which the facility had no deficiencies in during their last inspection. Additionally, the SMU standard accounted for 6 out of 24 deficiencies and includes 1 repeat deficiency. ODO received the UCAP for ODO’s last full inspection of NCDC in October 2023, which likely resolved most deficiencies ODO previously cited. ODO recommends ERO Salt Lake City continue to work with the facility to resolve the deficiencies that remain outstanding in accordance with contractual obligations.",

RJC went from 7 deficient standards and 47 deficiencies to 3 deficient standards and 33 deficiencies during this most recent special review. ODO identified most of the deficiencies as administrative in nature and the result of no facility SAAPI policy and procedure on hand. No available SAAPI policy resulted in 30 repeat deficiencies. The facility completed a UCAP for their last ODO special review that occurred in February 2023; however, most SAAPI deficiencies remain unresolved with a corrective action.",

ODO found four deficiencies in the remaining three standards. Since WDC’s last full inspection in March 2023, the facility’s overall compliance has trended upward. WDC went from 5 deficient standards and 12 deficiencies in March 2023 to 3 deficient standards and 4 deficiencies during this most recent full inspection, which included a repeat deficiency for no welfare check every 8 hours of a detainee on suicide watch. ODO received a completed uniform corrective action plan for the facility’s last full inspection in March 2023, which likely contributed to resolving most of the 12 deficiencies from the previous inspection.

ODO found two deficiencies in the one remaining standard. Since FCADC’s last full inspection in February 2023, the facility’s overall compliance with NDS 2019 has trended upward. FCADC went from 7 deficient standards and 8 deficiencies in February 2023 to 1 deficient standard and 2 deficiencies during this most recent inspection. ODO did not receive a completed UCAP for the facility’s FY 2023 full inspection in February 2023; however, ODO did receive the completed UCAP for their follow-up inspection in August 2023. The completed UCAP, higher facility staffing levels, and a better understanding of the NDS 2019 likely contributed to the facility’s improved performance. ODO received a completed UCAP for the facility’s FY 2023 follow-up inspection in January 2024. ODO recommends ERO Saint Paul continue to work with the facility to resolve the deficiencies that remain outstanding in accordance with contractual obligations.",

      "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 29 standards under PBNDS 2011 (Revised 2016) and found the facility in compliance with 26 of those standards. ODO found six deficiencies in the remaining three standards. Since WCDC’s last full inspection in January 2023, the facility’s overall compliance has stayed consistent; however, 4 out of 6 deficiencies ODO found are repeat deficiencies. WCDC went from 3 deficient standards and 5 deficiencies in January 2023 to 3 deficient standards and 6 deficiencies during this most recent inspection. ODO did not receive a completed uniform corrective action plan for the follow-up inspection in July 2023, which likely contributed to 3 repeat deficiencies by the facility in the SMU standard and 1 repeat deficiency by ERO Harlingen in the SDC standard. ODO recommends ERO Harlingen continue to work with the facility to resolve the deficiencies that remain outstanding in accordance with contractual obligations.",

      "SAFETY": "ODO reviewed the facility’s environmental health and safety policies and found the facility staff did not include procedures for detainees with disabilities to ensure their safety and security during the facility’s response to emergency situations (Deficiency EHS-258). ODO reviewed staff training records and found in out of records, no emergency plans training (Deficiency EHS-269). ODO observed the facility showers in housing units B and D and found the first-floor showers in each housing unit contained buildup of soap scum and rust on the shower walls (Deficiency EHS-5810). ODO toured the facility and found the first-floor showers in housing units B and D with rust stains and soap scum buildup on shower walls (Deficiency EHS-6411). ODO interviewed the facility’s health services administrator (HSA) and found neither the HSA nor designee made daily visual inspections of the medical facility, noting the condition of floors, walls, windows, horizontal surfaces, equipment, and furnishings (Deficiency EHS-6712).",
      "SECURITY": "ODO observed eight detainee housing units and common areas and found in four out of eight units, no posting of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) hotline and consulate contact numbers (Deficiency SDC-2113). Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, ODO verified the facility posted the DHS OIG Hotline and consulate contact telephone numbers in the specified housing units (C-1).",
      "CARE": "ODO reviewed medical staff training records and found in out of records, no annual training to recognize the signs of a hunger strike, to implement the procedures for referral for medical assessment, and for management of a detainee on a hunger strike (Deficiency HS-119). ODO reviewed the facility’s electronic medical records from August 2023 to January 2024 and found no recorded end date of one detainee’s hunger strike from January 4 to 5, 2024, (Deficiency HS-3420). ODO interviewed the facility’s HSA, reviewed the Geauga County Sherriff’s Office’s infection control policy, detainee medical records for detainees with suspected tuberculosis (TB), and found in out of records, no evaluation for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Deficiency MC-2221). ODO interviewed the HSA, reviewed Geauga County Sherriff Office’s infection control policy and detainee medical records, and found in out of records, no documented screening for COVID-19 while the facility operated in GREEN status according to ERO Custody Management’s Post Pandemic Emergency Guidelines and Protocol. ODO considers this inconsistency between practice and ERO policy to be an Area of Concern. ODO reviewed detainee medical records and found in out of records, no review by the facility provider of physical examinations conducted by a non-provider (Deficiency MC-2922). ODO reviewed training records of non-dental clinicians who conduct dental screenings and found in out of records, no annual training by a facility dentist on how to conduct an initial dental screening exam (Deficiency MC-4523). ODO reviewed medical staff training records and found in out of records, no training for responding to health-related emergencies within a 4-minute response time (Deficiency MC-5724). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed detainee medical records for detainees with suspected tuberculosis (TB) and found in out of records, no evaluation for human immunodeficiency virus infection (Deficiency MC-8425). ODO reviewed detainee medical records in which the facility prescribed psychotropic medications and found in out of records, no documented informed consent with a description of the medication’s side effects prior to administering (Deficiency MC-9326). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed the facility’s handbook and found the facility handbook did not address allowing a detainee’s representative to request and receive medical records (Deficiency MC-10227). ODO reviewed the facility’s sanitation and environmental conditions/bedding, linen and clothing policy, interviewed facility staff, and found the facility did not have temperature-appropriate clothing (cold weather clothing) to issue to detainees during in-processing (Deficiency PH-328). ODO reviewed the facility’s sanitation and environmental conditions/bedding, linen and clothing policy, interviewed facility staff and found the facility did not have jackets or other similar cold-weather gear; e.g., long sleeve undershirts and/or long sleeve tops to issue to detainees (Deficiency PH-629). ODO interviewed facility staff and found the facility replenishes personal hygiene items for indigent detainees only, and requires detainees with funds to purchase replacement personal hygiene items (Deficiency PH-1730). ODO reviewed staff training records and found in out of records, no training in comprehensive suicide prevention during orientation and refresher training at least annually.",

      "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 28 standards under PBNDS 2011 (2013 Errata) and found the facility in compliance with 23 of those standards. Since ICAF’s last rated inspection in April 2023, the facility has trended downward. ICAF went from 1 deficient standard and 1 deficiency during the April 2023 special review to 5 deficient standards and 11 deficiencies during this most recent full inspection.18 Of the five standards ODO cited deficiencies during this full inspection, SDC was the only standard that ODO also reviewed during the last special review, which had zero deficiencies cited. ODO received a completed uniform corrective action plan for the special review in April 2023, with no repeat nor priority component deficiencies noted, and likely resolved that previous deficiency. ODO recommends ERO Washington continue to work with the facility to resolve the deficiencies that remain outstanding in accordance with contractual obligations.",

ODO found eight deficiencies in the remaining four standards. Since STFRC’s last full inspection in November 2022, the facility’s overall compliance has remained consistent. STFRC went from 3 deficient standards and 9 deficiencies in November 2022, to 4 deficient standards and 8 deficiencies during this most recent inspection. ODO has not received the uniform corrective action plan for ODO’s last full inspection of STFRC in November 2022, but ERO San Antonio staff’s daily oversight of the facility likely helped ensure the facility’s overall compliance with the FRS 2020 and PBNDS 2011 (Revised 2016) standards. ODO recommends ERO San Antonio continue to work with the facility to resolve any deficiencies that remain outstanding in accordance with contractual obligations.",

      "SAFETY": "ODO reviewed the facility’s EHS program, observed hazardous chemicals inside the facility, and found no written hazardous communication program, outlining the proper labeling of chemicals, providing safety data sheets, nor training for employees (Deficiency EHS-17). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed the facility’s EHS program, interviewed facility staff, observed the chemical storage areas in the maintenance shop, kitchen, janitor’s closet, and sallyport, and found the following deficiencies in the sallyport: • No inventory record to account for three out of three hazardous materials: Novel Wash Bleach, Maine Mold and Mildew Remover, and Clean All Spray Lubricant (Deficiency EHS-28); • No perpetual inventory of the three hazardous materials (Deficiency EHS-39); • No inventory of the three hazardous materials (Deficiency EHS-410); and • No Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for the three hazardous materials (Deficiency EHS-511). Since the facility did not maintain SDS files and chemical inventories in the sallyport, ODO identified the following deficiencies: • No ready and continuous access to SDSs for the hazardous substances in current use (Deficiency EHS-612); • No review of SDS files by facility staff nor review of records by facility maintenance supervisor as necessary (Deficiency EHS-713); • No documentation of reviews maintained in an SDS master file (Deficiency EHS-914); and • No comprehensive and up-to-date list of emergency phone numbers (Deficiency EHS-1015). ODO observed Novel Wash Bleach, Maine Mold and Mildew Remover, and Clean All Spray Lubricant in the sallyport chemical storage area; however, the facility did not have inventory records for those chemicals (Deficiency EHS-1616). ODO inspected the facility’s sallyport chemical storage area, which the facility used for storing flammable and/or combustible liquids, and found the storage room was not in accordance with the Federal Hazardous Substances Labeling Act, to protect both life and property. Specifically, the room was overly stocked, and the facility did not store the hazardous substances in a self-closing non-flammable cabinet (Deficiency EHS-1717).",
      "SECURITY": "ODO reviewed the facility’s SDC program and policies and detainee handbook and found the facility did not have written procedures to route detainee requests to the appropriate ERO New Orleans officials (Deficiency SDC-1118). This is a priority component. ODO observed four housing units and found in four out of four units, no ICE/ERO posters (Deficiency SDC-2119). ODO reviewed the facility’s SMU program and detainee handbook and found no written procedures requiring a security supervisor, or equivalent, to interview detainees in disciplinary segregation every 7 days (Deficiency SMU-4520). ODO reviewed the facility’s SMU program and detainee handbook and found no written procedures requiring the facility administrator to review detainees in disciplinary segregation every 30 days (Deficiency SMU-5221).",
      "CARE": "ODO toured the FS area and found the facility did not maintain foods requiring refrigeration at 41 Fahrenheit (F) degrees or below. Specifically, the macaroni salad on the serving line measured 82 F degrees (Deficiency FS-1923). This is a priority component. ODO interviewed the FS director and found FS personnel did not receive preemployment medical examinations (Deficiency FS-8624). ODO reviewed staff training records and found in non-medical staff and medical staff records; facility staff received no annual hunger strike training (Deficiency HS-125). ODO reviewed detainee medical files and found in out of files, no initial medical, dental, nor mental health screenings completed by a health care practitioner (Deficiency MC-1226). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed medical records of detainees transferred to another detention facility and found in out of records, no medical transfer summaries. Since ODO did not observe a detainee transfer during the inspection to verify the facility includes medical transfer summaries with each detainee transfer, that a detainee can understand and are useful to future medical providers, ODO noted medical transfer summaries as an Area of Concern. ODO reviewed detainee medical files and found in out of files, no initial mental health screening (Deficiency SSHSPI-527). This is a priority component.",
      "ACTIVITIES": "N/A",
      "JUSTICE": "ODO reviewed the facility’s detainee handbook and found the handbook did not inform detainees they may file an informal grievance, they may seek staff assistance in filing a grievance, nor that facility staff may not subject any detainee filing a grievance to harassment, discipline, punishment, or retaliation (Deficiency GS-3428).",
      "CONCLUSION": "During this special review, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 10 standards under NDS 2019 and found the facility in compliance with 2 of those standards. ODO found 21 deficiencies in the remaining 8 standards. ODO found mainly administrative deficiencies related to no current inventory of hazardous materials and no completed mandatory staff training. Five of the deficiencies were priority component deficiencies. This was ODO’s first inspection of WCDC; therefore, ODO performed no trend analysis of this facility. Prior to this special review, the facility’s last known oversight inspection was an ERO Operational Review Self-Assessment, which occurred on January 4, 2023.29 Given the number of deficient standards, total number of deficiencies, and the number of priority component deficiencies ODO identified during this special review, ODO recommends ERO New Orleans increase oversight to improve compliance and work with the facility to resolve deficiencies in accordance with contractual obligations.",

      "SAFETY": "ODO reviewed the facility’s EHS program and written policies, interviewed a CCJ lieutenant, and found the facility had no written hazardous communication program, outlining proper chemical labeling, providing safety data sheets, nor employee training (Deficiency EHS-17). This is a priority component. ODO observed CCJ’s storage rooms and found the following deficiencies: No system for storing, issuing, and maintaining inventories of nor accountability for 57 hazardous materials (Deficiency EHS-28); No perpetual inventory of the hazardous substances used and stored in the food service and maintenance areas (Deficiency EHS-39); and No inventory records for each substance the facility had on-hand (Deficiency EHS-410).

ODO interviewed the CCJ FSD and found FS staff did not label all containers of toxic, flammable, or caustic materials for easy content identification. Specifically, in the chemical storage locker, ODO observed two spray bottles containing cleaning solution that the facility had not labeled (Deficiency FS-10624). ODO reviewed detainee medical files and found in out of files, detainees received initial medical, dental, and mental health screenings between 16 and 122 hours after arrival to CCJ, instead of within the required 12 hours (Deficiency MC-1225).

      "SAFETY": "ODO interviewed the safety manager, reviewed the facility’s EHS policies and procedures, and found the facility did not create a written hazardous communication program, outlining proper chemical labeling, providing Safety Data Sheets (SDSs), and training for employees (Deficiency EHS-17). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed the facility EHS program and policies, interviewed facility staff, inspected the facility’s chemical storage areas, and found the following deficiencies: • The facility did not establish a system for storing, issuing, and maintaining inventories and accountability for hazardous materials (Deficiency EHS-28); • No perpetual inventory of the hazardous (flammable, toxic, or caustic) substances used and stored at the facility (Deficiency EHS-39); • No inventory records for each substance used in the laundry and food service chemical storage areas (Deficiency EHS-410); and • No file of corresponding SDSs in every area using hazardous chemicals (Deficiency EHS-511). The lack of SDS files, chemical inventories, and a hazardous chemical master index resulted in the following related deficiencies: • Facility staff did not have ready and continuous access to SDSs for the hazardous substances in current use (Deficiency EHS-612); • The facility did not maintain SDS files for the maintenance supervisor’s review (Deficiency EHS-713); • The facility did not compile a master index of all hazardous substances in the facility, to include their locations and a master index of SDSs (Deficiency EHS-814); • No SDS master file or documentation of reviews (Deficiency EHS-915); and • No comprehensive and up-to-date list of emergency phone numbers (Deficiency EHS-1016). ODO interviewed the safety manager, reviewed 25 staff training records, and found in 25 out of 25 records, no training for prescribed precautions, wearing of personal protective equipment, and reporting hazards or spills to the designated authority. ODO also found no available SDS for each hazardous substance for staff to follow prescribed precautions (Deficiency EHS-1117). ODO interviewed the safety manager, observed the laundry and food service chemical storage areas, and found no inventory records for hazardous substances before, during, and after each use (Deficiency EHS-1618). ODO interviewed the safety manager, observed the laundry and food service chemical storage areas, and found unsecured toxic and caustic materials in their original containers with the manufacturer’s label intact on each container (Deficiency EHS-2019). ODO interviewed the safety manager, reviewed 25 staff training records, and found in 25 out of 25 records, no documented training for classification code and safe handling procedures of hazardous materials (Deficiency EHS-2320). ODO interviewed the safety manager, observed barber operations in seven housing units, and found the following deficiencies: • Facility staff did not ensure one-time use of towels. Specifically, staff did not provide towels nor ensure no reuse of towels provided by detainees (Deficiency EHS-4421); • No containers for waste, disinfectants, disposable headrest covers, laundered towels, and haircloths for barber operations (Deficiency EHS-4722); and • Barbers did not clean nor disinfect prior to use, hair care products that contact detainees (Deficiency EHS-4823).",
      "SECURITY": "ODO reviewed the facility’s SMU policies and procedures, interviewed facility leadership staff, and found no requirement for the signature of the facility administrator or assistant facility administrator to authorize the detainee’s continued placement in administrative segregation (Deficiency SMU-2524). ODO interviewed the security supervisor, reviewed facility SMU policies and procedures, and found the following deficiencies: • No implemented procedures for the regular review of all disciplinary segregation cases (Deficiency SMU-4425); • No written procedures for the regular review of all disciplinary segregation cases every 7 days (Deficiency SMU-4526); and • No written procedures requiring reviews by supervisory personnel of detainees in disciplinary segregation every 7 days and involving an interview with the detainee (Deficiency SMU-4627). ODO interviewed facility leadership, reviewed special management unit policies, and since the facility did not house ICE detainees in the SMU during the review period, ODO noted the following observations as Areas of Concern: • If the facility housed detainees in disciplinary segregation, they would not typically retain visiting privileges; • Disciplinary segregation detainees would not be permitted to use the visiting room during normal visiting hours; • No concurrence of the facility administrator and a health care professional for denial of recreation privileges for more than 7 days; • Facility staff does not notify ERO New Orleans when a detainee is denied recreation privileges more than 7 days; • Detainees in administrative or disciplinary segregation do not have the same law library privileges as the general population; • No requirement to justify for a detainee restricted from access to a phone for security reasons; • No requirement for a mental health care provider to conduct a face-to-face psychological evaluation of a detainee every 30 days; • No requirement for a health care professional to evaluate a detainee prior to placement into segregation; • No routine visits of detainees in segregation by medical staff; and • No policies or procedures for notification of ERO New Orleans.",
      "CARE": "ODO interviewed the food service manager (FSM) and found the facility meal scheduled the evening meal for 3:30 p.m. and breakfast for 6:30 a.m. resulting in a 15-hour gap between the evening meal and breakfast (Deficiency FS-1542). ODO interviewed the FSM, reviewed policies, procedures, and the current master menu, and found no documentation that a registered dietitian ever conducted a complete nutritional analysis of every master-cycle menu planned by the food service administrator (Deficiency FS-3243). This is a priority component. ODO interviewed the FSM, reviewed policies, procedures, and menus, and found no documented common-fare or holiday menu (Deficiency FS-6044). ODO interviewed the FSM, inspected the FS kitchen and storage areas, and found the facility did not provide a common-fare menu nor have available equipment for common-fare meal preparation (Deficiency FS-6645). ODO interviewed the FSM and found the chaplain did not have a documented ceremonial meal schedule for the inspection period or subsequent calendar year (Deficiency FS-6846). ODO interviewed the FSM and found the facility did not have a ceremonial meal schedule that included the date, religious group, estimated number of participants, and special foods required (Deficiency FS-6947). ODO interviewed the FSM, reviewed the personnel files for five FS staff, and found five out of five FS staff did not have a documented preemployment medical examination (Deficiency FS-8648). ODO interviewed the FSM, toured the FS areas of the facility, and found exhaust grease and dirt build-up in vents and filters, food debris on the exterior of a large mixer, dust accumulation in overhead vent, excessive food debris on the interior walls of three ovens, and nine inoperative light fixtures (Deficiency FS-9149). ODO reviewed FS documentation, interviewed the FSM, and found the FSM did not develop a schedule for the routine cleaning of equipment (Deficiency FS-9450). ODO interviewed the FSM, observed all areas of FS operations, and found no cleaning schedule for each FS area and no posted cleaning schedules in FS areas for easy reference (Deficiency FS-9651). Additionally, since the facility did not have a cleaning schedule in each FS area, they did not maintain a cleaning schedule with all areas and equipment grouped by frequency of cleaning (Deficiency FS-9752). ODO interviewed the FSM, reviewed FS documentation, toured the FS area, and found no inventories for hazardous chemicals stored in the FS department, to control and account for toxic, flammable, or caustic materials FS staff used (Deficiency FS-10553). ODO toured FS areas and found the facility stored Sysco Germicidal Ultra Bleach, Suma D1.5 General Purpose Pot and Pan Detergent, Ecolab Grease Strip Plus, and Diversity Hard Water Powder Detergent in the same storage room with food products, to include 50-pound bags of dry biscuit mix and kidney beans, 1-gallon containers of barbecue sauce, 60-gallon drums with plain sugar, dry cheese sauce, flour and salt. Additionally, the storage room was not locked or labeled for toxic, flammable, and caustic materials (Deficiency FS-10754). ODO interviewed the FSM, reviewed policies and procedures, toured the FS department, and found staff did not clean hood systems after each use to prevent grease build-ups. Specifically, the FS hood system had grease build-up on the hood and ventilation filters and the FSM confirmed no cleaning schedule for the hood system (Deficiency FS-11455). ODO interviewed the FSM and reviewed an Alabama Department of Public Health Annual Inspection Report, dated June 29, 2023, and found the facility implemented an annual independent inspection but had no written procedures for weekly inspections of all FS areas nor any documentation of weekly inspections of all FS areas during the inspection period (Deficiency FS-11656). ODO interviewed the FSM, reviewed policies and procedures, and found staff did not check refrigerator and water temperatures daily and record the results (Deficiency FS-11757). ODO interviewed the FSM, reviewed FS temperature logs, and found no temperature-check documentation for two out of two refrigerators and two out of two freezers (Deficiency FS-11958). ODO reviewed the initial medical, dental, and mental health screenings of detainees as well as the training records of 25 detention officers, and found in out of initial screenings, no documentation of an initial screening and in 12 out of 25 initial screenings, the detention officer who conducted the screenings did not have documented specialty training to conduct screenings (Deficiency MC-1259). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed detainee medical records and found in out of records, the facility did not complete a tuberculosis (TB) screening of the detainee prior to placing the detainee in general population (Deficiency MC-1860). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed medical staff and correctional officer training records, interviewed the health services administrator (HSA) and the training sergeant, and found in out of records, no documented training to respond to health-related emergencies within a 4-minute response time (Deficiency MC-5761). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed detainee medical records, interviewed the HSA, and found in out of records, the facility health care practitioner conducted COVID testing during intake without signed and dated consent forms (Deficiency MC-9262). This is a priority component. ODO interviewed the HSA, reviewed the facility handbook, and found no reference to detainees requesting and receiving their medical records (Deficiency MC-10263). ODO reviewed medical staff and correctional officer training records, interviewed the HSA and the training sergeant, and found in out of records, no annual suicide prevention training, and in out of records, no documented annual comprehensive suicide prevention training (Deficiency SSHSPI-264). This is a priority component. ODO interviewed the HSA and the facility training sergeant, reviewed the suicide prevention training curriculum, and found comprehensive suicide prevention training did not include standard first aid training, cardiopulmonary resuscitation training, nor training for the demographic, cultural, and precipitating factors of suicidal behavior (Deficiency SSHSPI-365). ODO reviewed the initial medical, dental and mental health screenings of detainees and the training records of detention officers and found in out of screenings, a health care practitioner nor a specially trained detention officer conducted an initial screening of a detainee within 12 hours of the detainee’s arrival (Deficiency SSHSPI-566). This is a priority component. ODO interviewed the HSA, reviewed facility TID policies and procedures, and found written procedures did not provide for the facility’s direct coordination with ERO New Orleans in communicating news of the serious illness or death of a detainee (Deficiency TID-967).",
      "ACTIVITIES": "ODO interviewed facility staff, reviewed facility policies and procedures, and found the facility generally affords detainees 1-hour of recreation, 2 days per week (Deficiency R-368). This is a priority component. ODO interviewed the facility recreation staff, observed the outdoor recreation area, and found no exercise equipment located in the outdoor recreation area (Deficiency R-869). ODO interviewed the facility recreation staff, reviewed the facility recreation policies and procedures, and found denial of recreation privileges for more than 15 days does not require the concurrence of the facility administrator and a health care professional (Deficiency R-1970).",
      "JUSTICE": "N/A",
      "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 10 standards under NDS 2019 and found the facility in compliance with 2 of those standards. ODO found 64 deficiencies in the remaining 8 standards. ODO found both administrative and operational deficiencies. The administrative deficiencies were mostly due to no updated facility policies to reflect NDS 2019 requirements, lack of all required staff training, and lack of current inventory for hazardous substances used at the facility. Ten of the deficiencies were priority component deficiencies. This was ODO’s first inspection of BCCC; therefore, ODO performed no trend analysis of this facility. Prior to this special review, the facility’s last known oversight inspection was an ERO Operational Review Self-Assessment (ORSA), which occurred on January 9, 2023.71 Per ERO’s ORSA policy guidelines, FODs are responsible for developing effective oversight relationships with facilities eligible to participate in the ORSA process. Given the number of deficient standards, total number of deficiencies, and the number of priority component deficiencies ODO identified during this special review, ODO recommends ERO New Orleans increase oversight to improve compliance and work with the facility to resolve deficiencies in accordance with contractual obligations.",

      "SAFETY": "ODO reviewed the facility EHS program and policies and found the facility did not create a hazardous communication program, outlining chemical labeling, safety data sheet (SDS) distribution, and employee training (Deficiency EHS-17). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed the facility EHS program and policies, interviewed facility staff, inspected the chemical storage areas in the maintenance department, food service department, sallyport, and janitor’s closet, and found the following deficiencies: • No inventory records to account for 11 out of 11 hazardous materials: Great Stuff, Acetone, Spartan Glass Cleaner, Bright Solutions, Spartan Stainless-Steel Cleaner and Polish, Sprayway, Great Value Bleach, Maxim, Spartan Clothesline Fresh, Steriphene II, and EasyPaks (Deficiency EHS-28); • No perpetual inventory of the hazardous (flammable, toxic, or caustic) substances used and stored at the facility (Deficiency EHS-39); • No inventory records for each substance used at the facility (Deficiency EHS-410); and • No file of corresponding SDSs in every area using hazardous chemicals (Deficiency EHS-511). The lack of SDS files, chemical inventories, and a hazardous chemical master index resulted in the following related deficiencies: • Facility staff did not have ready and continuous access to SDSs for the hazardous substances in current use (Deficiency EHS-612); • Facility staff did not review SDS files nor did the facility maintenance supervisor review records as necessary (Deficiency EHS-713); • The facility did not compile a master index of all hazardous substances in the facility, to include their locations and a master index of SDSs (Deficiency EHS-814); • No documentation of reviews maintained in an SDS master file (Deficiency EHS-915); • No comprehensive and up-to-date list of emergency phone numbers (Deficiency EHS-1016); • No prescribed precautions to facility staff for the use of hazardous substances, wearing personal protective equipment, nor reporting hazards or spills (Deficiency EHS-1117); • No inventory records for documenting hazardous substances before, during, and after use (Deficiency EHS-1618); and • No SDSs governing the use of flammable or combustible liquids (Deficiency EHS-1819). ODO reviewed the facility EHS program and policies, interviewed facility staff, inspected the chemical storage areas in the maintenance department, food service department, sallyport, and janitor’s closet, and found the facility stored five out of five liquids without the prescribed “Flammable” or “Combustible” labeling as per the Federal Hazardous Substances Labeling Act. Specifically, the facility’s sallyport contained the designated flammable storage cabinet, but ODO observed no labeling for Great Stuff and acetone in the maintenance department, Bright Solutions and Spartan Stainless-Steel Cleaner and Polish in the food service department, and Bright Solutions and Steriphene II in the janitor’s closet (Deficiency EHS-1720). ODO reviewed the facility EHS program and documentation, interviewed facility staff, and found no hazardous material training for facility staff (Deficiency EHS-2321). Additionally, the facility did not have procedures for detainees with disabilities included in their emergency plan (Deficiency EHS-2522). ODO observed facility barber operations, interviewed the facility administrator and contract barber, and found the following deficiencies: • Insufficient lighting in the barbershop room. ODO determined an average of 25.88 foot-candles for lighting in the barbershop instead of the standard for 50 foot-candles (Deficiency EHS-4523); • No lavatory or sink with hot and cold running water and no available waterless hand sanitizer in the barbershop (Deficiency EHS-4624); and • No waste container nor disinfecting equipment after each use by the barber (Deficiency EHS-4725). ODO interviewed the health services administrator (HSA), reviewed the facility program for the safe handling and disposal of used needles and other potentially sharp objects, inspected the medical exam room, and found the following deficiencies: • No established uniform procedure to address exposure to bloodborne pathogens (Deficiency EHS-5026); • The inventory records for all items that posed a security risk did not include two suture removing kits containing scissors (Deficiency EHS-5127); • The HSA did not designate an individual to reconcile the inventories weekly (Deficiency EHS-5228); • No approved contractor for the disposal of biohazardous waste (Deficiency EHS-5529); and • No written exposure-control plan in the event of a needle stick (Deficiency EHS-5730). ODO inspected the facility and found environmental health conditions did not meet recognized standards of hygiene. Specifically, ODO noted soap scum build up on shower walls and floors in housing units 500, 600, and 1500 and missing floor tiles in housing units 600 and 1500 (Deficiency EHS-6431).",
      "SECURITY": "ODO reviewed the facility UOFR policy and found no procedures governing mandatory after-action reviews (Deficiency UOFR-9432). ODO reviewed the facility UOFR training curriculum and found it did not include crisis intervention, conflict de-escalation, recognizing signs and symptoms of mental illness, nor reporting requirements (Deficiency UOFR-10333). ODO reviewed the facility SMU policies and training program, interviewed the facility administrator, and found the following deficiencies: • No procedures for the regular placement review of detainees held in administrative segregation (Deficiency SMU-2134); • No procedures for the regular review of all disciplinary segregation cases (Deficiency SMU-4435); and • No SMU staff training program (Deficiency SMU-8636).",
      "CARE": "ODO toured the facility FS department, reviewed documentation, interviewed the food service coordinator (FSC), and found the following deficiencies: • The facility prepared and stored pinto beans for kosher and vegetarian meals beyond 24 hours (Deficiency FS-4737); • No documented pre-employment medical examinations for FS staff (Deficiency FS-8638); and • No inventory records to account for six out of six toxic, flammable, or caustic materials stored in the FS department: Spartan Glass Cleaner, Bright Solutions, Spartan Stainless-Steel Cleaner and Polish, Sprayway, Great Value Bleach, and Maxim (Deficiency FS-10539). ODO reviewed the fire suppression inspection records and found the last qualified contractor inspection of the system was on January 18, 2023 (Deficiency FS-11240). ODO reviewed the facility FS policy, interviewed the FSC, and found the facility did not implement written procedures nor maintain documentation for weekly inspections of all FS areas, including dining, storage, equipment, and food-preparation areas (Deficiency FS-11641). ODO reviewed the facility FS procedures and documentation, interviewed the FSC, and found from September 1, 2022, through August 31, 2023, the FS staff did not: • Document daily refrigerator and water temperature checks (Deficiency FS-11742); • Conduct temperature checks of the dishwasher for every meal nor for the walk-in refrigerator and freezer according to a site-specific schedule (Deficiency FS-11843); and • Record and file daily temperature checks to ensure accessibility (Deficiency FS-11944). ODO reviewed non-medical and medical staff training records and found in out of training records, no documented hunger strike training at orientation and annually thereafter nor any training curriculum for hunger strikes (Deficiency HS-145). ODO reviewed detainee medical records and found credentialed health care personnel did not perform duties within their scope of practice. Specifically, on August 8 and August 18, 2023, a licensed practical nurse (LPN) and a certified nurse aide (CNA) performed comprehensive health assessments, but the Idaho Nursing Act, dated May 21, 2020, and the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act, Rules 24.34.01 and 23.01.01.490, do not authorize LPNs and CNAs to conduct comprehensive health assessments (Deficiency MC-1146). This is a priority component. As a result of the LPN and CNA conducting the detainee assessments on August 8 and August 18, 2023, ODO identified the following related deficiencies: • Unauthorized medical staff conducted two detainee comprehensive health assessments (Deficiency MC-2847); • The facility provider did not review two detainee physical examinations by personnel other than the provider (Deficiency MC-2948); and • Unauthorized medical staff conducted two detainee initial dental screenings (Deficiency MC-4449). ODO reviewed detainee medical records and found in out of records, medical staff conducted intake screenings between 15 and 130 hours after arrival and no intake screening at all for 1 detainee (Deficiency MC-1250). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed detainee medical records and found in out of records, no documented information obtained by medical staff regarding any known acute, emergent, or pertinent past or chronic medical conditions. Specifically, the detainee arrived at the facility on November 29, 2022, and ODO found no documentation of an intake screening before the detainee’s transfer on November 30, 2022 (Deficiency MC-1351). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed detainee medical records and found in out of records, the facility had no documentation confirming detainees received tuberculin skin tests nor chest X-rays in addition to symptom screenings (Deficiency MC-1852). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed facility MC policy, interviewed medical staff, and found the written plans did not address: • The management of infectious and communicable diseases (Deficiency MC-2553). This is a priority component; • Reporting and collaboration with local or state health departments (Deficiency MC-2654); and • Exposure to blood borne pathogens (Deficiency MC-7455).",
      "ACTIVITIES": "N/A",
      "JUSTICE": "ODO reviewed the facility handbook and found no references to available services for disability accommodations (Deficiency DH-265). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed detainee detention files and found in out of files, no detainee acknowledgement of receipt of the facility and ICE National Detainee handbooks (Deficiency DH-966). This is a priority component.",
      "CONCLUSION": "During this special review, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 10 standards under NDS 2019 and found the facility in compliance with 2 of those standards. ODO found 60 deficiencies in the remaining 8 standards. ODO found mainly administrative deficiencies due to no updated facility policies to reflect NDS 2019 requirements for the lack of all required staff training and lack of current inventory for hazardous substances used at the facility. Twelve of the deficiencies were priority component deficiencies. This was ODO’s first inspection of MCD; therefore, ODO performed no trend analysis of this facility. Prior to this special review, the facility’s last known oversight inspection was an ERO Operational Review Self-Assessment (ORSA), which occurred.",

ASF went from two deficient standards and four deficiencies to four deficient standards and seven deficiencies. A deficiency was found in the DH standard, which was not reviewed during the previous inspection and three deficiencies were found in the UOFR standard due to a UOF incident during this review period. ERO New Orleans provided ODO with the uniform corrective actions plan for ODO’s last inspection of ASF in August 2022, which likely contributed to the facility’s sustained compliance with the PBNDS 2011 (2013 Errata) and no repeat deficiencies.

ODO interviewed the facility’s leadership and found the maintenance supervisor or facility designee did not compile a master index of all hazardous substances, to include their locations in the facility, along with a master index of Safety Data Sheets (SDS) (Deficiency EHS-810). ODO interviewed the facility’s staff, reviewed the SDS master file, and found staff maintained no documented reviews in the SDS master file (Deficiency EHS-911). ODO interviewed the facility’s maintenance supervisor and found the master index did not include a comprehensive and up-to-date list of emergency phone numbers (fire department, poison control center, etc.) (Deficiency EHS-1012). ODO inspected the facility and found in three out of three locations, no current inventory records of hazardous substances before, during, and after each use (Deficiency EHS-1613). ODO reviewed the facility’s emergency plans and found facility staff did not review and update these plans on an annual basis. Specifically, staff last reviewed and updated emergency plans on October 26, 2021 (Deficiency EHS-2714). ODO reviewed the facility’s EHS program and found the facility did not maintain a cleanup kit for use in cases of spills of blood or other bodily fluids (Deficiency EHS-6915). Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, the facility obtained bloodborne pathogen cleanup kits and placed them in both sergeants’ offices and both control rooms. The facility subsequently ordered 20 more cleanup kits and issued training notices to all staff regarding the location and use of the bloodborne pathogen cleanup kits (C-1).",
      "SECURITY": "ODO interviewed the facility’s leadership, reviewed the facility’s UOFR policies, and found the facility lacks written procedures governing mandatory after-action reviews for use-of-force incidents or application of restraints (Deficiency UOFR-9416). ODO interviewed the facility’s leadership, reviewed UOFR policies, and noted the following observations as Areas of Concern: • No consistent use of a team member to operate a camera and record calculated use of force incidents; • No video of the faces of all team members; • No video of the team leader offering the detainee a last chance to cooperate before team action in a language or manner the detainee understands, outlining use-of-force procedures, engaging in confrontation avoidance, and issuing use-of-force order; • No video of the entire use-of-force team operation, unedited, until detainee is in restraints; and • No close-up video of detainee’s body during the medical exam, focusing on any detainee injuries and/or staff injuries, if any.",
      "CARE": "ODO reviewed the facility’s FS program and found staff did not control nor account for on-hand flammable and caustic materials. ODO found no accountability records for available chemicals, nor did staff know current, on-hand amounts (Deficiency FS-10517). ODO reviewed the training files of correctional officers and medical staff and found all mental health contract staff did not have documentation of initial and subsequent annual training to recognize the signs of a hunger strike, to implement the procedures for referral for medical assessment, and to manage a detainee on a hunger strike. ODO noted this as an Area of Concern. ODO also observed this facility holds detainees between 24 to 72 hours and concluded the remote likelihood of a detainee engaging in a hunger strike. Still, the possibility of the facility receiving a detainee while on a hunger strike exists, and for this reason, ODO noted this as an Area of Concern. ODO reviewed the facility’s training program and found no training for correctional officers on how to respond to health-related emergencies within 4-minutes (Deficiency MC-5718). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed the facility’s jailer training and medical training curricula, interviewed the director of nursing and the training lieutenant, and found the facility did not provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training to correctional staff (Deficiency MC-5819). ODO reviewed the facility’s training records of correctional staff and medical care staff and found in out of correctional officer records, no training on the administration of first aid and CPR (Deficiency MC-5920). ODO reviewed the facility’s handbook and found no instruction on how detainees and their representatives may request and receive medical records (Deficiency MC-10221). ODO reviewed the training records of correctional staff and medical staff and found in out of medical staff records, no documented, comprehensive suicide prevention training during orientation and subsequent, annual refresher training (Deficiency SSHSPI-222). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed the training records of correctional staff and medical staff, interviewed the director of nursing and the training lieutenant, and found in out of correctional officer records and in out of the medical staff records, no standard first aid and CPR training (Deficiency SSHSPI-323).",

      "CONCLUSION": "During this special review, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with nine standards under NDS 2019 and found the facility in compliance with four of those standards. ODO found 16 deficiencies in the remaining 5 standards. Since this was ODO’s first inspection of MCJ, ODO did not conduct a trend analysis. ODO reviewed nine memoranda of understanding (MOU), signed between the facility and the Waco sub-office, and found good practices in place regarding: shared responsibilities pertaining to records retention; the handling of special management unit (SMU) eligible detainees; processing and storage of detainee property; documented consent for psychotropic medications; and the transferring of ICE detainees from MCJ to the ICE Montgomery Processing Center. ODO recognizes the formalized division of such responsibilities as a Best Practice. However, ODO found an acting supervisory detention and deportation officer signed the MOUs instead of an assistant field office director or higher and no signature by the contracting officer’s representative. ODO recommends ERO Houston work with the facility to resolve the remaining deficiencies in accordance with contractual obligations.",

      "CONCLUSION": "During this unannounced follow-up inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 18 standards under PBNDS 2011 (Revised 2016) and found the facility in compliance with 13 of those standards. ODO found 16 deficiencies in the remaining 5 standards. Since SLDC’s last full inspection in March 2023, the facility’s overall compliance has trended down. SLDC went from 4 deficient standards and 6 deficiencies in March 2023 to 5 deficient standards and 16 deficiencies during this most recent inspection. The facility’s decline in performance is largely due to missing records from 2 SMU files, which resulted in 10 deficiencies. SLDC did not have any deficiencies in SMU during their last inspection. ODO did not review the Facility Security and Control standard during the March 2023 inspection as it was not an FY 2023 core standard, and this standard accounted for 2 out of 16 deficiencies found during this most recent inspection. ODO received the UCAP for ODO’s last full inspection of SLDC in March 2023, which likely contributed to the facility having no repeat deficiencies. ODO recommends ERO New Orleans work with the facility to resolve any deficiencies that remain outstanding in accordance with contractual obligations.",

ISADF went from one deficient standard and two deficiencies in February 2023 to two deficient standards and three deficiencies during this most recent inspection. ODO received a completed UCAP for the full inspection in February 2023, which likely is the 7 “The facility medical staff shall sign each individual’s record when the medical staff member visits a detainee in the SMU.” See ICE NDS 2019, Standard, Special Management Unit, Section (II)(D)(2)(b). 8 “Health care personnel shall conduct face-to-face medical assessments at least once daily for detainees in an SMU.” See ICE NDS 2019, Standard, Special Management Unit, Section (II)(M). 9 “Each facility shall establish a written procedure to allow legal service providers and legal assistants to telephone the facility in advance of a visit to determine whether a particular individual is detained in that facility.” See ICE NDS 2019, Standard, Visitation, Section (II)(G)(6).",

ODO found 19 deficiencies in the remaining 8 standards. Since WCDC’s last full inspection in January 2023, the facility’s overall compliance has trended down. WCDC went from 3 deficient standards and 5 deficiencies in January 2023 to 8 deficient standards and 19 deficiencies during this most recent follow-up inspection, which includes two repeat deficiencies, one in MC and one in SSHSPI, which is also a priority component. One deficiency found in the SMU standard is also a priority component. ODO did not review the SDC and the GS standards during the January 2023 inspection.",

Specifically, ODO found in 6 out of the 11 housing units (B-2, B-3, C-2, F-3, F-4, and G-4), clutter (papers, trash, and garbage) and excessive property in the open bay bunks. Additionally, ODO made the following observations: graffiti on the walls in unit A-1; dried toilet paper covering the vents in units A-1 and F-4; dirt and debris under the stairwell in unit B-2; and stained ceiling tiles in unit F-4 (Deficiency EHS-116). This is a repeat deficiency.",
      "SECURITY": "ODO toured 15 housing units and found in 14 out of 15 units, outdated DHS Office of Inspector General Hotline posters (Deficiency SDC-277).",
      "CARE": "ODO interviewed the food service administrator (FSA), reviewed 25 weekly FS inspections, and found in 3 out of 25 inspections, the FSA did not inspect the FS areas for the weeks of May 7, 2023, June 18, 2023, and July 9, 2023 (Deficiency FS-4158).",
      "ACTIVITIES": "ODO observed 15 housing units and found in 15 out of 15 units, no posted telephone access hours (Deficiency TA-259). Corrective Action: Prior to completion of the inspection, the facility initiated corrective action by posting the telephone access hours in all housing units (C-1). ODO observed 15 housing units and found in 15 out of 15 units, no telephone access hours posted by the telephones (Deficiency TA-3010). Corrective Action: Prior to completion of the inspection, the facility initiated corrective action by posting the telephone access hours near all housing unit telephones (C-2).",
      "JUSTICE": "ODO reviewed the facility’s grievance log and found in 2 out of 25 grievances, facility staff did not provide a response within 5 days of the receipt of the grievance, but instead, responded between 7 and 9 days of receipt of the grievances (Deficiency GS-5711).",
      "CONCLUSION": "During this follow-up compliance inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 18 standards under PBNDS 2011 (Revised 2016) and found the facility in compliance with 13 of those standards. ODO found six deficiencies in the remaining five standards. Since TIPC’s last full inspection in February 2023, the facility’s overall compliance has trended slightly down. TIPC went from one deficient standard and one deficiency in February 2023 to five deficient standards and six deficiencies during this most recent inspection. One deficiency in EHS is a repeat deficiency for general cleanliness. ODO did not review the SDC, TA, nor GS standards during the February 2023 inspection as they were not FY 2023 core standards, and these standards accounted for four out of the six deficiencies found during this most recent inspection. ODO has received the UCAP for ODO’s last full inspection of TIPC in February 2023. ODO recommends ERO continue to work with the facility to resolve the remaining deficiencies in accordance with contractual obligations.",

      "CARE": "ODO interviewed the food service administrator, inspected the food service refrigeration units on June 14, 2023, and observed the sallyport freezer’s internal temperature was 19 Fahrenheit (F) degrees. ODO then reviewed the refrigeration temperature logs for the previous 2 days and found staff recorded the temperatures for the freezer at 8 F degrees. The facility’s policies, Safe and Secure Food Storage, and Inspections of the Food Service Department, state freezer temperatures must be maintained at zero degrees or below. Upon ODO’s observation of the freezer and review of the logs, facility staff removed all food items from the freezer, placed the food in a different freezer that was maintained at zero degrees and submitted a work order to repair the sallyport freezer. The NDS 2019 Food Service standard only requires food service staff to check freezer equipment temperatures and record the results, they do not specify a maximum temperature for the facility’s freezers. ODO noted this observation as an Area of Concern.",
      "ACTIVITIES": "ODO reviewed detainee telephone access at the facility and found the facility imposed an automatic cut-off on legal calls at 15 minutes (Deficiency TA-2410).",
      "JUSTICE": "N/A",
      "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 17 standards under NDS 2019 and found the facility in compliance with 14 of those standards. ODO found four deficiencies in the remaining three standards. Since RGDC’s last full inspection in December 2022, the facility has shown steady improvement; however, ODO notes this was the first inspection of RGDC under the NDS 2019 standards since the facility modified their contractual requirement, removing reference to the Performance-Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS) 2008.",

ODO found 20 deficiencies in the remaining 4 standards. ODO found mainly administrative deficiencies due to ECJ staff not having documented training, not developing a ceremonial meal schedule, and not tracking hazardous substances the facility used; however, the staff training deficiencies in Medical Care and Suicide Prevention and Intervention are priority component deficiencies as well as the facility not completing TB screenings on newly arrived detainees. This was ODO’s first inspection of ECJ, and therefore ODO performed no trend analysis of this facility. ODO recommends ERO Salt Lake City to continue to work with the facility to resolve any deficiencies that remain outstanding in accordance with its contractual obligations.",

TDHRC went from three deficient standards and eight deficiencies in December 2022 to two deficient standards with three deficiencies during the most recent unannounced inspection. The facility’s improved performance may have resulted from the completion of the UCAP for ODO’s last inspection of TDHRC in December 2022; however, ODO notes all three deficiencies are procedural requirements in which the facility had zero deficiencies during the full inspection earlier this FY.

      "SAFETY": "ODO reviewed the facility’s EHS program and written policies, interviewed facility staff, and found the written hazardous communication program did not outline training for employees (Deficiency EHS-18). This is a priority component. ODO interviewed facility staff, reviewed the facility’s EHS program and policies, inspected the chemical storage areas in the food service department and facility main warehouse, and found: • No system for storing, issuing, and maintaining inventories nor accountability for hazardous materials. Specifically, the facility did not inventory and account for 25 out of 25 hazardous chemicals, to include Lime Away and Oasis Quat Sanitizer (Deficiency EHS-29); • No perpetual inventory of the hazardous (flammable, toxic, or caustic) substances used and stored in the area (Deficiency EHS-310); • No keeping of inventory records for each substance (Deficiency EHS-411); and • No inventory records for hazardous substances documenting current before, during, and after use (Deficiency EHS-1612). ODO interviewed a facility captain, reviewed EHS documentation, and found the facility did not comply with standards and regulations issued by the National Fire Protection Association. Specifically, the facility did not conduct fire drills during the inspection period (Deficiency EHS-3313). This is a priority component. ODO interviewed the director of nursing, reviewed the EHS program, and found no documentation of daily visual inspections of the medical areas to note the condition of floors, walls, windows, horizontal surfaces, equipment, and furnishings (Deficiency EHS-6714).",
      "SECURITY": "USE OF FORCE AND RESTRAINTS (UOFR) ODO reviewed the facility UOFR policy, interviewed a facility captain, and found the facility did not require staff who witness a UOFR incident to document by memorandum due to the staff’s use of body cameras. The facility did not have any UOFR incidents involving detainees during this inspection period, but ODO identified the discrepancy between facility policy and procedures and the NDS 2019 requirement. ODO noted this as an Area of Concern. SPECIAL MANAGEMENT UNIT (SMU) ODO reviewed the facility’s SMU policy, interviewed a facility sergeant, and found the facility’s procedures required staff to observe detainees in the SMU hourly, but NDS 2019 requires staff to observe and log observations at least every 30 minutes on an irregular schedule. Since the facility did not place any detainees in the SMU during this inspection period, ODO the discrepancy between facility policy and procedures and the NDS 2019 requirement as an Area of Concern. SEXUAL ABUSE AND ASSAULT PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION (SAAPI) ODO reviewed the facility’s written SAAPI policy and procedures, interviewed a facility major, and found: • No procedures for notifying ERO Atlanta of a sexual abuse allegation (Deficiency SAAPI-515); • No procedures for the investigation and discipline of assailants by coordinating with ERO to ensure completion of investigations for all allegations of sexual abuse and assault (Deficiency SAAPI-916); • No procedures for coordination of internal administrative investigations with ICE OPR (Deficiency SAAPI-1117); • No inclusion of the facility’s requirement to cooperate with all ICE/ERO audits (Deficiency SAAPI-1318); • ERO Atlanta did not review nor approve the facility’s SAAPI policy and procedures (Deficiency SAAPI-1419); and • The SAAPI policy did not fully comply with NDS 2019 within 90-days of the facility’s adoption of the standard (Deficiency SAAPI-1520). ODO reviewed the facility’s orientation program, interviewed facility staff, observed housing unit postings, and found the facility did not provide instructions to detainees on methods for reporting sexual abuse and assault to the ICE Detention and Reporting Information Line nor ICE OPR (Deficiency SAAPI-4321). ODO toured the facility housing units, interviewed facility staff, and found ERO Atlanta did not provide the facility with a SAAPI awareness notice nor pamphlet for distribution, and therefore, the facility did not post the notice on housing-unit bulletin boards. Additionally, the facility did not post the name of the prevention of sexual assault compliance manager nor mailing address of the local organization assisting detainee victims of sexual abuse and assault (Deficiency SAAPI-5222). ODO reviewed the facility’s 2022 PREA Investigation spreadsheet, interviewed facility staff, and found the facility did not provide the review findings to ERO Atlanta (Deficiency SAAPI-16223).",
      "CARE": "FOOD SERVICE (FS) ODO reviewed the facility’s FS program, interviewed the facility food service director (FSD) and chaplain, reviewed the common-fare menu, and found: • No special menus for the 10 Federal holidays (Deficiency FS-6024); • No ceremonial-meal schedule for the subsequent calendar year nor forwarding this schedule to the facility administrator (Deficiency FS-6825); and • No ceremonial-meal schedule with the date, religious group, estimated number of participants, nor special foods required (Deficiency FS-6926). ODO reviewed the facility’s FS program, interviewed the FSD, and found no cleaning schedule for: • The routine cleaning of equipment (Deficiency FS-9427); • Each food service area and posted for easy reference (Deficiency FS-9628); and • Identification of all areas (walls, windows, vent hoods, etc.) and equipment (chairs, tables, fryers, ovens, etc.) grouped by frequency of cleaning (Deficiency FS-9729). ODO reviewed the facility’s FS program, interviewed facility staff, and found the facility did not account for toxic, flammable, or caustic materials daily. Specifically, ODO found no inventories during the inspection period for 12 caustic materials, to include Lime Away and Oasis Quat Sanitizer, stored in the FS department (Deficiency FS-10530). ODO reviewed the facility’s FS policy, interviewed the FSD, and found the facility did not implement written procedures nor maintain documentation for weekly inspections of all food service areas, including dining, storage, equipment, and food-preparation areas (Deficiency FS-11631). ODO interviewed the FSD, reviewed the facility’s FS policy and equipment temperature logs, and found the facility did not conduct nor document daily temperature checks of the dishwasher nor three-compartment sink (Deficiency FS-11832). HUNGER STRIKES (HS) ODO reviewed non-medical and medical staff training records and found in out of training records, no documented hunger strike training at orientation and annually thereafter nor any training curriculum for hunger strikes (Deficiency HS-133). MEDICAL CARE (MC) ODO reviewed detainee medical records and found in out of records, the facility did not process new detainees for tuberculosis in accordance with the most current Centers for Disease",
      "ACTIVITIES": "RECREATION (R) ODO observed the indoor recreation areas, interviewed a facility captain, and found the facility offered no fixed nor movable exercise equipment for detainees (Deficiency R-839).",
      "JUSTICE": "DETAINEE HANDBOOK (DH) ODO reviewed the facility handbook and found no references to available services for disability accommodations nor the SAAPI program (Deficiency DH-240). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed staff training records and found in out of records, no documented facility handbook training (Deficiency DH-741). ODO interviewed a facility captain, reviewed the facility handbook, and found the facility last reviewed the handbook in March 2021 (Deficiency DH-842). ODO interviewed a facility captain and an ERO Atlanta DO and found the facility did not have a procedure to document a detainee’s receipt of the ICE National Detainee Handbook nor facility handbook (Deficiency DH-943). This is a priority component.",
      "CONCLUSION": "During this special review, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 10 standards under NDS 2019 and found the facility in compliance with 2 of those standards. ODO found 36 deficiencies in the remaining 8 standards. ODO found mainly administrative deficiencies due to CCJ staff not updating facility written policy to include ICE/ERO reporting requirements, and inconsistent record-keeping practices for staff training. Six of the deficiencies were priority component deficiencies. This was ODO’s first inspection of CCJ, and therefore ODO performed no trend analysis of this facility. ODO recommends ERO Atlanta work with the facility to resolve any",

Specifically, facility staff classified one detainee with a low-level classification, but housed him in a high-level classification housing unit (Deficiency CCS-286).",
      "CARE": "ODO reviewed 12 detainee medical care summaries (transfer summaries) and found in 1 out of 12 summaries, 1 detainee was on a constant suicide watch at the time of transfer, and the facility’s provider did not check the box next to “Suicide watch/Psychiatric decompensation within past month” and wrote “None” under the Other Medical Problems field (Deficiency MC-18414).",

ODO found nine deficiencies in the remaining three standards. Since CCA FCC’s last full inspection in November 2022, the facility has shown improvement. CCA FFC went from 4 deficient standards and 10 deficiencies in November 2022 to 3 deficient standards and 9 deficiencies during this most recent inspection. Additionally, CCA FFC went from seven repeat deficiencies to zero repeat deficiencies. However, during this follow-up inspection, ODO found deficiencies in the MC and CCS standards, and CCA FCC did not have deficiencies in those standards in November 2022. ERO Phoenix provided ODO with the UCAP for ODO’s last inspection of CCA FCC in April 2023, which likely resolved the deficiencies ODO found in the SMU standard during the last inspection; however, CCA FCC continues to have deficiencies in the SMU standard. ODO recommends ERO continue to work with the facility to resolve the remaining deficiencies in accordance with the contractual obligations.",

      "SAFETY": "ODO toured all areas of the facility, to include the housing units, and found staff and detainees did not have ready and continuous access to safety data sheets (SDS) for substances they used in the work area. Specifically, ODO found glass cleaner and sanitizer without corresponding SDS sheets in the common areas of housing units A, C, and D; the women’s housing unit; the restricted housing unit (RHU); and the special needs unit (SNU) (Deficiency EHS-19). This is a priority component. ODO interviewed the deputy warden and maintenance supervisor and found no established system for storing, issuing, nor maintaining inventories of and accountability for hazardous materials (Deficiency EHS-210). ODO toured all areas of the facility, to include the housing units, and found every area using hazardous substances did not maintain a file of corresponding SDS. Specifically, ODO found glass cleaner and sanitizer stored for use in housing units A, C, and D; the women’s housing unit; the RHU; and the SNU without corresponding SDS sheets (Deficiency EHS-511). ODO toured all areas of the facility, to include the housing units, and found staff and detainees did not have ready and continuous access to SDS for the substances they used while in the work area. Specifically, ODO found glass cleaner and sanitizer without corresponding SDS sheets in the common areas of housing units A, C, and D; the women’s housing unit; the RHU; and the SNU (Deficiency EHS-612). ODO interviewed the facility maintenance supervisor and found no master index compiled by the maintenance supervisor for all hazardous substances used at the facility nor master file of all SDS (Deficiency EHS-813). ODO interviewed the facility maintenance supervisor and found no documentation of reviews in the SDS master index (Deficiency EHS-914). ODO interviewed the facility maintenance supervisor and found the master index did not include a comprehensive, up-to-date list of emergency phone numbers (fire department, poison control center, etc.) (Deficiency EHS-1015). ODO toured all areas of the facility, to include the housing units, and observed spray bottles of glass cleaner and sanitizer without labels in the common areas of housing units A, C, and D; the women’s housing unit; and the administrative area bathroom (Deficiency EHS-2216). ODO interviewed the facility maintenance supervisor and training lieutenant, reviewed 25 training records of staff who work with hazardous materials, and found in 25 out of 25 records, no appropriate training for classification codes and safe handling procedures (Deficiency EHS-2317). ODO interviewed the deputy warden and found no annual staff review nor updates of the facility’s emergency plan (Deficiency EHS-2718).",
      "SECURITY": "ODO reviewed BCJ SDC procedures, interviewed ERO Philadelphia and facility staff, and found no written procedures to route detainee requests to the appropriate ICE/ERO officials. Specifically, ODO found facility staff verbally routed requests to ERO Philadelphia (Deficiency SDC-1119). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed BCJ SDC procedures, interviewed ERO Philadelphia and facility staff, and found the facility staff did not route detainee request forms to ERO Philadelphia without reading, altering, or delaying such requests (Deficiency SDC-1220).",

This report contains the deficiencies ODO verified prior to leaving the facility. Standards that indicate zero deficiencies in the table on the next page documents that ODO found zero deficiencies in the line items reviewed prior to stopping the inspection and leaving the facility. ODO did not conduct a closeout briefing with facility and local ERO officials to discuss preliminary findings; however, ODO shared a summary of these findings with ERO management officials. This final report is provided to ICE leadership to: (i) assist ERO in developing and initiating a corrective action plan; and (ii) provide senior executives with an independent assessment of facility operations. ODO’s findings are intended to inform ICE executive management in its decision-making to better allocate resources across the agency’s entire detention inventory.",

      "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 18 standards under PBNDS 2011 (Revised 2016) and found the facility fully in compliance with all 18 standards. Since EFCF’s last full inspection in November 2022, the facility has shown steady improvement. EFCF went from four deficient standards and seven deficiencies to no deficient standards and no deficiencies during this most recent follow-up inspection. The facility’s improved performance is likely the result of a combined effort between ERO Phoenix and EFCF in completing the uniform corrective action plan for ODO’s last inspection of EFCF in November 2022. ODO recommends ERO Phoenix continue to work with the facility to maintain a high-level of compliance with the PBNDS 2011 (Revised 2016).",

      "CARE": "ODO interviewed the FS administrator, reviewed the facility’s written FS procedures, and found the facility did not conduct weekly inspections of all FS areas (Deficiency FS-11613). This is a repeat deficiency.\n\nODO interviewed the HSA, reviewed the facility’s medication administration policy and detainee medical records, and found in out of 25 records, the facility did not distribute medication according to the facility’s 2-step identification verification process (verbal and visual identification). Instead, medical staff used a one-step verification process, which resulted in facility medical staff administering medication to the incorrect detainee (Deficiency MC-6114). This is a priority component.",
      "ACTIVITIES": "ODO interviewed a facility sergeant, reviewed the electronic recreation log, and found from March 5 to April 28, 2023, the facility offered recreation to housing units C and J between 1 and 4 days each week for 1 hour and not at least 5 days each week (Deficiency R-315). This is a priority component.\n\nODO interviewed a facility sergeant, reviewed the special management unit recreation log, and found from April 7 to 13, 2023, the facility offered detainees housed in SMU recreation only three times per week and from April 14 to 24, 2023, the facility offered recreation only four times per week (Deficiency R-1516). This is a priority component.",
      "JUSTICE": "ODO interviewed a facility sergeant, observed the law library, and found the facility provided computer for detainees (Deficiency LLLM-317). This is a priority component.",
      "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 16 standards under NDS 2019 and found the facility in compliance with 10 of those standards. ODO found 12 deficiencies in the remaining 6 standards. Since NCDC’s last full inspection in November 2022, the facility’s overall compliance with the NDS 2019 has trended up, but ODO cited three repeat deficiencies and five priority component deficiencies in this report. NCDC went from 8 deficient standards and 23 deficiencies in November 2022 to 6 deficient standards and 12 deficiencies during this most recent inspection. However, two of the standards that ODO found deficient were Use of Force and Medical Care, which NCDC did not have deficiencies in during their full inspection earlier this FY. If the priority component and repeat deficiencies are not corrected prior to their next full inspection in FY 2024, this facility is at risk of not achieving a passing rating. ODO has not received a UCAP for ODO’s last full inspection of NCDC in November 2022, which likely contributed to the repeat deficiencies ODO cited. ODO recommends ERO Salt Lake City continue to work with the facility to resolve the remaining deficiencies in accordance with contractual obligations.",
