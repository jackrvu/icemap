ODO interviewed a facility supervisor, observed PH hygiene kits provided to detainees upon admission, reviewed property-issued forms, and found detainees had to purchase skin lotion from the facility\u2019s commissary (Deficiency PH-1424). ODO interviewed a facility lieutenant, toured detainee housing units, and found the facility did not provide detainees with a reasonably private toilet facility and observed entrances to toilets as completely open and in the direct line of sight of other detainees, staff, and visitors (Deficiency PH-1825); detainees the privacy required to perform bodily functions without being viewed by staff of the opposite gender and observed entrances to toilets as completely open and in the direct line of sight of other detainees, staff, and visitors (Deficiency PH-1926); and detainees with disabilities the amenities nor the support needed for self-care and personal hygiene in a reasonably private environment and observed entrances to toilets as completely open and in the direct line of sight of other detainees, staff, and visitors (Deficiency PH-2227).", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO interviewed a facility lieutenant, reviewed the facility\u2019s electronic recreation logs for 4 detainees, and found from April 14 to May 7, 2024, the facility only offered recreation to the detainees 14 out of 24 days (Deficiency R-329). This is a repeat deficiency and a priority component. ODO interviewed a facility lieutenant, reviewed the facility\u2019s electronic logs for 2 detainees housed in the SMU, and found from April 14 to May 7, 2024, the facility only offered recreation to the detainees for 5 out of 24 days (Deficiency R-1530). This is a priority component. ODO toured six detainee housing units and found three out of six units did not have notices posted at each telephone notifying detainees that their calls were subject to monitoring (Deficiency TA-4131).", "JUSTICE": "ODO interviewed 24 detainees, a facility lieutenant, reviewed 25 detainee handbook electronic logs, and found the facility provides facility and ICE National Detainee Handbooks to detainees electronically via housing unit tablets; however, the detainee acknowledgement form does not clearly indicate that detainees acknowledge receipt of both handbooks, which ODO notes as an Area of Concern. ODO reviewed one grievance a detainee submitted to ERO Salt Lake City staff on April 27, 2024, and found ERO Salt Lake City staff did not respond until May 8, 2024 (Deficiency GS-1532).", "CONCLUSION": "During this follow-up inspection, ODO assessed the facility\u2019s compliance with 18 standards under NDS 2019 and found the facility in compliance with 8 of those standards. ODO found 24 deficiencies in the remaining 10 standards. Since NCDC\u2019s last full inspection in October 2023, the facility\u2019s compliance with the NDS 2019 has trended down. NCDC went from 4 deficient standards and 12 deficiencies in October 2023 to 10 deficient standards and 24 deficiencies during this most recent inspection. Ten out of 24 deficiencies were in the EHS and PH standards, which the facility had no deficiencies in during their last inspection. Additionally, the SMU standard accounted for 6 out of 24 deficiencies and includes 1 repeat deficiency. ODO received the UCAP for ODO\u2019s last full inspection of NCDC in October 2023, which likely resolved most deficiencies ODO previously cited. ODO recommends ERO Salt Lake City continue to work with the facility to resolve the deficiencies that remain outstanding in accordance with contractual obligations.", "latitude": "36.8678591", "longitude": "-97.0691621", "matched_facility_name": "Kay County Detention Center", "similarity_score": 0.676, "confidence_level": "LOW", "facility_field_office": "Chicago Field Office", "facility_city": "Newkirk", "facility_state": "OK", "facility_street": "1101 West Dry Road"}

Two Environmental Health and Safety standard deficiencies were because the facility\u2019s housing units experienced heating and cooling system problems leading up to and during the inspection in addition to one housing unit having roof damage, which resulted in significant condensation forming on the housing units' walls, ceilings and floors.

ODO interviewed the FSM, toured the FS areas of the facility, and found exhaust grease and dirt build-up in vents and filters, food debris on the exterior of a large mixer, dust accumulation in overhead vent, excessive food debris on the interior walls of three ovens, and nine inoperative light fixtures (Deficiency FS-9149). ODO reviewed FS documentation, interviewed the FSM, and found the FSM did not develop a schedule for the routine cleaning of equipment (Deficiency FS-9450). ODO interviewed the FSM, observed all areas of FS operations, and found no cleaning schedule for each FS area and no posted cleaning schedules in FS areas for easy reference (Deficiency FS-9651). Additionally, since the facility did not have a cleaning schedule in each FS area, they did not maintain a cleaning schedule with all areas and equipment grouped by frequency of cleaning (Deficiency FS-9752). ODO interviewed the FSM, reviewed FS documentation, toured the FS area, and found no inventories for hazardous chemicals stored in the FS department, to control and account for toxic, flammable, or caustic materials FS staff used (Deficiency FS-10553). ODO toured FS areas and found the facility stored Sysco Germicidal Ultra Bleach, Suma D1.5 General Purpose Pot and Pan Detergent, Ecolab Grease Strip Plus, and Diversity Hard Water Powder Detergent in the same storage room with food products, to include 50-pound bags of dry biscuit mix and kidney beans, 1-gallon containers of barbecue sauce, 60-gallon drums with plain sugar, dry cheese sauce, flour and salt. Additionally, the storage room was not locked or labeled for toxic, flammable, and caustic materials (Deficiency FS-10754). ODO interviewed the FSM, reviewed policies and procedures, toured the FS department, and found staff did not clean hood systems after each use to prevent grease build-ups. Specifically, the FS hood system had grease build-up on the hood and ventilation filters and the FSM confirmed no cleaning schedule for the hood system (Deficiency FS-11455). ODO interviewed the FSM and reviewed an Alabama Department of Public Health Annual Inspection Report, dated June 29, 2023, and found the facility implemented an annual independent inspection but had no written procedures for weekly inspections of all FS areas nor any documentation of weekly inspections of all FS areas during the inspection period (Deficiency FS-11656). ODO interviewed the FSM, reviewed policies and procedures, and found staff did not check refrigerator and water temperatures daily and record the results (Deficiency FS-11757). ODO interviewed the FSM, reviewed FS temperature logs, and found no temperature-check documentation for two out of two refrigerators and two out of two freezers (Deficiency FS-11958). ODO reviewed the initial medical, dental, and mental health screenings of detainees as well as the training records of 25 detention officers, and found in out of initial screenings, no documentation of an initial screening and in 12 out of 25 initial screenings, the detention officer who conducted the screenings did not have documented specialty training to conduct screenings (Deficiency MC-1259). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed detainee medical records and found in out of records, the facility did not complete a tuberculosis (TB) screening of the detainee prior to placing the detainee in general population (Deficiency MC-1860).

ODO reviewed medical staff and correctional officer training records, interviewed the HSA and the training sergeant, and found in out of records, no annual suicide prevention training, and in out of records, no documented annual comprehensive suicide prevention training (Deficiency SSHSPI-264). This is a priority component. ODO interviewed the HSA and the facility training sergeant, reviewed the suicide prevention training curriculum, and found comprehensive suicide prevention training did not include standard first aid training, cardiopulmonary resuscitation training, nor training for the demographic, cultural, and precipitating factors of suicidal behavior (Deficiency SSHSPI-365). ODO reviewed the initial medical, dental and mental health screenings of detainees and the training records of detention officers and found in out of screenings, a health care practitioner nor a specially trained detention officer conducted an initial screening of a detainee within 12 hours of the detainee\u2019s arrival (Deficiency SSHSPI-566). This is a priority component. ODO interviewed the HSA, reviewed facility TID policies and procedures, and found written procedures did not provide for the facility\u2019s direct coordination with ERO New Orleans in communicating news of the serious illness or death of a detainee (Deficiency TID-967).", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO interviewed facility staff, reviewed facility policies and procedures, and found the facility generally affords detainees 1-hour of recreation, 2 days per week (Deficiency R-368).

ODO found 64 deficiencies in the remaining 8 standards. ODO found both administrative and operational deficiencies. The administrative deficiencies were mostly due to no updated facility policies to reflect NDS 2019 requirements, lack of all required staff training, and lack of current inventory for hazardous substances used at the facility. Ten of the deficiencies were priority component deficiencies. This was ODO\u2019s first inspection of BCCC; therefore, ODO performed no trend analysis of this facility. Prior to this special review, the facility\u2019s last known oversight inspection was an ERO Operational Review Self-Assessment (ORSA), which occurred on January 9, 2023.71 Per ERO\u2019s ORSA policy guidelines, FODs are responsible for developing effective oversight relationships with facilities eligible to participate in the ORSA process. Given the number of deficient standards, total number of deficiencies, and the number of priority component deficiencies ODO identified during this special review, ODO recommends ERO New Orleans increase oversight to improve compliance and work with the facility to resolve deficiencies in accordance with contractual obligations.", "latitude": "42.3166565", "longitude": "-85.1757947", "matched_facility_name": "Calhoun County Correctional Center", "similarity_score": 0.882, "confidence_level": "MEDIUM", "facility_field_office": "Detroit Field Office", "facility_city": "Battle Creek", "facility_state": "MI", "facility_street": "185 E.

ODO noted this as an Area of Concern. ODO also observed this facility holds detainees between 24 to 72 hours and concluded the remote likelihood of a detainee engaging in a hunger strike. Still, the possibility of the facility receiving a detainee while on a hunger strike exists, and for this reason, ODO noted this as an Area of Concern. ODO reviewed the facility\u2019s training program and found no training for correctional officers on how to respond to health-related emergencies within 4-minutes (Deficiency MC-5718). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed the facility\u2019s jailer training and medical training curricula, interviewed the director of nursing and the training lieutenant, and found the facility did not provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training to correctional staff (Deficiency MC-5819).

This is a priority component.

ODO found 16 deficiencies in the remaining 5 standards. Since this was ODO\u2019s first inspection of MCJ, ODO did not conduct a trend analysis. ODO reviewed nine memoranda of understanding (MOU), signed between the facility and the Waco sub-office, and found good practices in place regarding: shared responsibilities pertaining to records retention; the handling of special management unit (SMU) eligible detainees; processing and storage of detainee property; documented consent for psychotropic medications; and the transferring of ICE detainees from MCJ to the ICE Montgomery Processing Center. ODO recognizes the formalized division of such responsibilities as a Best Practice. However, ODO found an acting supervisory detention and deportation officer signed the MOUs instead of an assistant field office director or higher and no signature by the contracting officer\u2019s representative.

SLDC went from 4 deficient standards and 6 deficiencies in March 2023 to 5 deficient standards and 16 deficiencies during this most recent inspection. The facility\u2019s decline in performance is largely due to missing records from 2 SMU files, which resulted in 10 deficiencies.

ODO did not review the Facility Security and Control standard during the March 2023 inspection as it was not an FY 2023 core standard, and this standard accounted for 2 out of 16 deficiencies found during this most recent inspection.
