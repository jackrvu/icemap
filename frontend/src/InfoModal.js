                        We strongly believe that the American people should have full insight into the actions of its democratically-elected government.

                        icemap.dev aims to provide a comprehensive view of the activities and the injustices of America's Immigration Customs Agency (ICE),
                        with specific focus on its Enforcement and Removal Operations department (ERO).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        icemap aggregates both unstructured and structured data from a multitude of public online sources, then distills these data into useful sources and figures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        icemap does not aim to hinder operations nor spark fear, but instead provide a lens with which the American people can
                        observe.
