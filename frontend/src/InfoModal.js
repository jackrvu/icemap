                        We strongly believe that the American people should have full insight into the actions of its democratically-elected government.

                        icemap.dev aims to educate the American people on the activities and injustices of America's Immigration Customs Agency (ICE),
                        with specific focus on its Enforcement and Removal Operations department (ERO).

                    <p>
                        icemap aggregates both unstructured and structured data from a multitude of public online sources, consolidating this signal into useful
                        information for the American people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Icemap does not aim to hinder operations nor spark fear, but instead provide a lens with which the American people can
                        observe.
